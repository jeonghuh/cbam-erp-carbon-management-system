## Project Overview

With the implementation of CBAM in 2026, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) will be required to report carbon emissions for exports to the EU.

This project proposes an ERP-based automated carbon management system that:

- Calculates carbon emissions automatically using ERP data
- Tracks carbon emission allowances
- Provides real-time dashboard insights
- Generates CBAM-compliant reports automatically

---

## Why This Project Matters

CBAM requires companies to:

- Measure product-level embedded emissions
- Submit verified emission reports
- Purchase carbon certificates if emissions exceed thresholds

Manual calculation is costly and complex for SMEs.

This system reduces burden by integrating directly with ERP systems.
